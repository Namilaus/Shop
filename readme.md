# My Online Store Project 

This is just the frontend part of my online store project! Backend coming soon...(Hopefully)

## What it does so far 
- Shows products with images
- Add stuff to cart
- Change quantity
- See total price
- Get notifications when you add items
- Stores cart data in localStorage (temporary solution until backend is ready)

## How it is built
Frontend stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts

## Todo Backend üìù
Need to add:
- Node.js server
- Database (probably MySQL)
- User authentication
- Real payment processing
- API endpoints for:
  - Products
  - Cart
  - Users
  - Orders

## How to use it 
1. Download all files
2. Open index.html in your browser
3. Click around and try adding things to cart!
(Note: Everything is frontend only for now, so refreshing the page will reset everything except cart)


## Known Issues üêõ
- No real database (using localStorage for now)
- Cart data isn't permanent
- No real checkout process
- No user accounts
- Mobile menu could be better
- Need to add more products

## Future Updates üéØ
Frontend improvements:
- Add more products
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Add product filters

Backend additions:
- Build REST API
- Add user authentication
- Connect to database
- Real payment processing
- Order history
- Admin panel
